# CS1530 - Group 8: Helping Hands Volunteer Website
By: Joel Julin, Jeremy Romano, Boaz Joesph, Dailynn Tejeda, Adam Sheelar, and Nathan Nichol

Our group's focus for our semester project was on community and social services and
we chose to create a website that enables users to connect with volunteers and
volunteer coordinators in their area to promote community involvement. Through our
collective experience in volunteering, we found that information could be more easily
available for most volunteer opportunities. As a result, our website Helping Hands
aims to enable people who want to get more involved in their community to have the
option to do so in a straightforward and informative way by providing the resource
of a centralized "opportunity board" for all users.
